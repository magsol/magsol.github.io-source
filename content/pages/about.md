So, this is a thing I made.

My name is Shannon Quinn. I'm an assistant professor in the [Computer Science](http://cs.uga.edu/~squinn) and [Cellular Biology](http://cellbio.uga.edu/directory/shannon-quinn) departments
at the University of Georgia. Which is ironic at some level, considering my
undergraduate degree in Computer Science came from Georgia Tech ([GO JACKETS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygxDs_zcayo)).

I'm trained in computer vision, bioimaging, distributed computing, and machine learning. Most of my work somehow involves eigensolvers and solving large systems of linear equations, but it's a sure bet that if it involves public health, I'm interested. I'm particularly fascinated by the problem of large-scale integration of heterogeneous data sources to paint a more cogent and cohesive picture than would be possible with only a single source of information.

I'm a huge proponent of open source development, and a big believer in open science. I try to make tools, data, and course materials all available with open source licenses. I also like contributing to various open source projects such as Apache Mahout, scikit-learn, and others.

In my copious (lulz) free time, I enjoy board gaming, video gaming, and anything that involves working up a sweat: baseball, football, basketball, racquetball, cycling, hiking, and especially running.
